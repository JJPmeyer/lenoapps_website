### How many templates can I create?

You can create unlimited templates on all plans. The limit is on how many times you can apply templates per month.

### Can I edit a template after creating it?

### Can I delete templates?

Yes, you can delete templates you no longer need. This won't affect existing subitems created from the template.

Yes! You can set templates as "Team" or "Workspace" to share them with others. See our [Permissions Guide](../features/permissions) for details.

### Can I apply a template to multiple items at once?

### Can I edit subitems after applying a template?

Yes! After applying a template, you can edit any subitem values just like normal subitems.

### Do templates work with existing subitems?

Templates create new subitems. They don't modify existing ones. You can delete existing subitems first if needed.

- **Team templates**: You and selected team members
- **Workspace templates**: All workspace members

### Can I control who can edit my templates?

Yes! You can set edit permissions separately from view permissions. See our [Permissions Guide](../features/permissions) for details.

### What if I leave the company?

If you're the owner of shared templates, you can transfer ownership to another team member before leaving.
